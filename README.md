Janus Project
Overview:
Janus is a device design to control access to equipment with the innovation center. The principal concept being that the device will provide a means to allow only authorized/certified individuals to operate a machine through control of either power or low voltage input to an enabling line. The device consists of a microprocessor, proximity reader and mechanical card retention mechanism.

The principal of operation is as follows:
The operator inserts his/her proximity credential into a slot in the enclosure of the device. The card insertion triggers a limit switch which in turn enables the proximity reader to read the card. The card is authenticated by the microprocessor and if the user is authorized sets an I/O line high and in turn activates a low voltage relay which can be used to signal an enable line in the equipment or connected to a high voltage relay/contactor to enable the device to be powered. If the prox credential is removed, releasing the limit switch, the i/o line is brought low.
